		<p>A roar bellowed from with the scattered packs of gryphons. The booming sound sent the other packs averting from its location to incircle the source without getting too close. The soldiers mounted on their backs were jolted into attention, preparing themselves for the threat that seemingly came out of nowhere within the darkness night and grey clouds. Struggling sounds of snarls and squawks could be heard among the flaps of the great majestic wings.</p>
		<p>The calm light blue eyes opened up with minimum sign of worry, drifting over the shadowed clouds towards the ruckus of the other gryphon pack, just able to see them thanks to the curse he wore. It was agreed upon departure that they were better suited in small packs than in one giant cluster. In the core of flustered gryphons sat a ferocious worgen, claws out and swiping at another gryphon, he was in a struggle with two of the gryphons. A kinsman perched on the other gryphon was trying to keep it in control but was more a fight for himself than actual control. He was laughing, and not just a chuckle. This blundering buffoon was laughing loudly above the clouds. There were not meant to be any hostile creatures nearby but the marshal's patience was still slowly running out.</p>
		<p><q>What is all this disturbance about? We might not be a threat to many but doesn't take long for some</q>. John's voice barked out in the night in a commanding tone, his light blue eyes almost felt like a searchlight for the people able to notice them at his close vicinity. Before seated comfortably in his saddle, almost able to have a good nap, he was now standing upright in the harness to scowl towards the pack north-west of him. With squinting eyes, he could just barely identify the worgen within the night's sky.</p>
		<p><q>The bloody oversized chicken ate my damn food!</q> the roar bellowed in return from the furious worgen fighting talons, beaks and claws to defend his meal. One claw at the grasp of what looks like a husk of rabbit and the other claw swiping defensively at the other gryphon. Lupus, a normally calm member of the brigade had seen himself in a stressful hunger and this gryphon had sniffed out his meal. Perched above was Edward, another member of the Brigade, giving a more struggle to not fall of than to stop the war of the roasted rabbit.</p>
		<p><q>Ye should've seen ye face, Lupey!</q> Edward laughed out loud as he worked hard to hold onto the reins, sending the leather straps straining at his clutch.</p>
		<p>John took hold of the reins and pulled to turn his own gryphon towards the unnecessary ruckus. The gryphon, younger of the kind, settled to give a little countering tug but was quickly reminded who was in charge as the marshal let out a deep growl. It was proven to not be needed as a handler was heading towards the distressed riders.</p>
		<p>Three fast swipes was all this little struggle needed. Lupus had in his fury made the gryphon flinch as he swiped out towards its throat, making it let go of his now partially gnawed meal - it was still good enough he agreed with himself. The last swipe managed to strike a side strap, giving Edward a scare for his life as his confident perch above took a sudden swoop to the left side, making him let out a frightened yelp when the feeling of his left foot didn't have a stirrup to stand in. The jolt sent him whimpering as he was hugging the neck of the snack lusting gryphon while the handler from Stormwind assisted them in getting it under control.</p>
