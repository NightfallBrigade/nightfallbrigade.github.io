  <p>The shadowy banks of the mist was pierced by the rising sun, splitting it into smaller lingering remnants of the night's cold grasp on Surwich, opening up the village to the vast blanket of the cold south seas, the tropical coast of Stranglethorn lingering along the right side view. Seagulls screeching out as the dawn brings a fresh feast of small sea life seeking the sunlight. </p>
  <p>The armored figure of the Nightfall Marshal stood still perched at his post, the moment of solitude had been welcomed, only very few had questioned him. He glanced over his shoulder at the tents scattered around, at the lanterns that would soon be drowned out by the natural light, it was the calm before another day. The morning was brought to glory as the sound of a bell rung through the village, the toll of dawn.</p>
  <p>His legacy was awakening from its slumber within the core of the village. As his eyes ran along the structures, he could sense the movements, hear the scuffing around of humans and worgen alike, all united for the same goal - home. The clattering sounds of plated armor united with the skittering of mail and bundled armor of leather and cloth was a sure telling that they were soon to gather for the main building, breakfast was a sure reward for anyone waking up.</p>
  <p>His eyes scowled at his palm, forming a pair of crow's feet wrinkles as they remained locked at the item, a sollom little wedding band. For him, the night held no rest. There was preparations to approve and coordinate with the brigade and the gryphon masters of the Alliance. After all this, he had been left alone, he had left himself alone to take in a moment for himself. Contemplating to toss the ring across the sea and to whatever isle was perched far enough away, the thought had brought him to a chuckle, he probably could if he had a spark of magic to help him. Other moments made him ponder to just leave the ring hanging at the nail of a watch post, a token of leaving something broken behind but as the morning light shined upon him and the ring, he was settled himself with passing the thought and stashing the ring away in a secure pouch. </p>
  <p>The flickering shadows of in the distance made the marshal flinch, beyond his reach, above the ocean under the cover of the sunlight flew a large flock of gryphons. He could almost imagine hearing them screech in the distance as they snatched a seagull for snacking. His eyes weren't keep enough but he was sure enough that at least two handlers were herding these armored magnificent beasts towards Surwich - at his request.</p>
  <p>He chuckled softly as he saluted the new day with two hard slams on his breastplate - this was to be a new chapter, no need to stick to the old chapters no more. He left the dock with a broad smile, nodding respectfully at the soldiers who scurried past him, offering a quick salute before mustering at the main building for the breakfast call. He may not command legions but for him, his brigade was his people and the goal was their heart's desire.</p>
  <p>In the echo of boosted feet and clawed paws, he silently agreed with his gut feeling. The rumbling gnawing feeling that he had been feeling the past few hours - hunger. He snarled out before setting into a brisk walk to join the queue for the breakfast call. Resolute to bring his people onwards to glory, after he's had his fill and sated his hunger.</p>
