	<p>John watched as tired soldiers got up in the morning, the forced march from Ashenvale to Lor'danel certainly left a mark on them all. The wounded, those too far out to recover were transported to the elven capitol. They would not be burdened with them, if forced to retreat. For four days, they resisted the might of the Horde, their toughest soldiers. For four days, they repelled every attack thrown their way, smiling and laughing as they saw the Horde scatter before the might of the Alliance. The Horde figured they would face opposition from the Elves here. How wrong were they, Alliance does no leave its allies in need. The Alliance Vanguard assembled it self hastily, chaotically, portals flared open, delivering them to Darnassus. On the next day, they crossed the sea strait between the capitol and the mainland, and deployed. And just in time</p>
	<p>That first day was a mess. Incomplete lines, a hundred different opiniones as what should be done. They hardly had any success that day. Horde proved a match. Their sheer numbers provided a match more then enough for the disorganised Alliance forces. Confusion was great in the Alliance camps, as supplies were not getting to where they had to be. Tempers were running high, but somehow, they survived. Cooler heads prevailed, forming resistance pockets throughout the woods. His afflicted Gilneans proved so well suited for this type of combat, being able to traverse the forest as fast as any elf could, and a darn much faster then anyone foolish enough to mount a steed of any kind. Even the fierce Sun Hawk could not fly through the canopy, the trees were too dense, they had to fly above them or they would sooner or later get snared in the canopy by traps or the branches them self.</p>
	<p>On the second day, some semblance of order was established. The alliance forces captured moved from Orendils retreat and captured Maestra's post. And held it. Horde sent wave after wave of soldiers at them, and each wave was reppelled. It was not easy, the enemy kept coming and some of the soldiers there were clearly not accustomed to battle or were simply to thickheaded to understand how battles work, constantly charging after the retreating enemy, ino the hilld, getting drawn in to small skirmishes that always ended in a draw. Their forces won and lost the Stardust spire a few times, always recapturing it. Stormwind Infantry showed the Horde they are not feared without reason. The elves holed them self in the Silverwing Grove, repelling any and all attacks against their fortifications. Led by their Sentinels, elven forces reminded the Horde noone walks through the elven forests unless they allow it. They paid dearly for it. Once again, afflicted Gilneans proved their worth here. Their speed and stealth while moving through the forest proved invaluable. Then they lost Harrow to a Worgens lack of self control. Then they lost Denholme, to the lynch mob. They had to transport him to Stormwind, to await a trial.</p>
	<p>On the third day, things settled into a routine. Alliance held their ground, while Horde tried to take it. With no success. All lines held firmly, especially at Maestra, where John and Marshal Falheim took command. Horde tried and tried, but every time they made a push, they were reppeled. Even their underhanded tactics failed them. The Plague, some sort of hold wind created by their death knights repelled the Alliance forces shortly. Every time they came down the easter hills or the South road, they were reppeled. While Alliance still suffered from some of their soldiers and officers insubrodination, they managed to hold. And not only hold, on what would be that days last Horde attempt, Horde made a massive mistake, following the Alliance forces down the South road, only to suddenly be flanks by skirmishers from both sides just as the main shield wall pushed as well. The broke them apart, killing many, the rest sent to scurry to their bases, to lick their wounds. But on that day, they lost the Silverwing Grove. THe Horde managed to bring their siege weapons and the Grove's defenses fell. Luckly, noone can track the elves through the forests and most of them made it out to Maestra.</p>
	<p>Fourth day saw the situation more grim, due to the loss of the Grove and the attrocities the Horde did there after the fall. But morale was still high. Stardust spire held, proudly, the Stormwind Infantry fighting tooth and nail to hold it, and managing somehow to become a real thorne in the Horde's side. Maestra held, proudly, firmly. Eight times they tried, every time they had their noses bloodied. The one time they thought they had won, their flanking attack got flanked. Their forces smashed, they ran away once again. But the situation was looking grim. Alliance forces blew up bridges to slow the Horde siege weapons. It was a half measure. A slowing down tactic, nothing else. And their numbers swelled. They had a long fight ahead.</p>
	<p>On the fifth day, the tables turned drastically. Horde finally managed to find tha passes that led behind Maestra point and assaulted Orendil's retreat directly. John had little choice, sending half of his forces to liberate and hold it. That left him with merely half a force and a large base to defend. Seeing the situation was dire, after consulting with the High Marshal, they withdrew all forces to Orendil and established lines there. Unfortunately, as time would tell, it was not enough. Horde sent a massive force. And due to the size of the area around Orendil's retreat, the Alliance formations were not large enough. Once again, an order to retreat was sounded, for all Alliance forces, to retreat behind the Whisp wall in Darkshore. The full force of the Alliance retreated all the way north, and the planning began on how to retaliate.</p>
	<p>And this brings us to the sixth day, with John watching as the soldiers prepare for battle. The wounded have been evacuated. Now...blood will flow.</p>
